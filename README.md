# Udacity Pixel Art Maker Project

This project takes HTML (index.html) and defines elements of a Pixel Art Maker on the page.

The CSS file (styles.css) defines the styles for various elements of the HTML file.  
  This was provided by Udacity and I did not change it.
  
Designs.js is the real essense of this project and was modified.  The function makeGrid() created a grid with which
  colorful designs may be drawn one "pixel" at a time.

### Installation
Simply click and drag 'index.html' to a google chrome browser tab and play.  

### Project Motivation
The project motivation for this Pixel Art Maker is to practice using event listeners in web pages and to design interactive grids which incorporate many user inputs.

### Results
Now you can define a grid of a size of your choosing and color in the grids.

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Acknowledgement to UDACITY for writing 'index.html' and 'styles.css' files.  Designs.js was left blank for students to modify to satisfy the project requirements.
