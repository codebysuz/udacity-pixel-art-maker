# udacity-pixel-art-maker

//This project takes HTML (index.html) and defines elements of a Pixel Art Maker on the page.
//The CSS file (styles.css) defines the styles for various elements of the HTML file.  
  This was provided by Udacity and I did not change it.
//Designs.js is the real essense of this project and was modified.  The function makeGrid() created a grid with which
  colorful designs may be drawn one "pixel" at a time.
